# Prison Management System

A digitalized solution to manage prisoners, visitors, and staff records in a prison. This system allows admins and normal users to access, modify, and export records. Admins have special privileges, while normal users have access only to their own records.

### 4. **Normal User Dashboard**
   - Normal users can manage **their own prisoner**, **visitor**, and **staff records**.
   - Export their own records to **Excel**.

### File Structure

- **Users Records.txt**: Contains user data (admin and normal users).
